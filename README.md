# WatIsThis
What is this?

This is all the information you will get about me.
I am Jason/Jawwson
One question that you may have is: How are you typing this if you are supposedly dead? 
I guess I'm not really dead. I'm undead. No, not a zombie. A WIGLILOOPER. It has to be in capitals. 
Most people don't know what a WIGLILOOPER is. A WIGLILOOPER is a powerful being that is incredibly smart. 
They appear when a incredibly smart genius dies. That's me.
I enjoy playing games. I don't need money or food or anything, so there is no problem with playing games. 
IT'S FUN.
I also make games, which is less fun but still fun.
Everything I do is for fun.
I have a small bit of coding experience but not much because I started yesterday.

Goodbye.

P.S. I kinda miss being alive for one reason. Food. I can't have good food anymore. Tacos taste like nothing. Hot dogs taste like nothing. Everything tastes like nothing.
